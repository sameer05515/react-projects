# Project Aims

- **Create a Reusable Component**: Develop a component to render tree data where each object contains at least two fields: `name` and `children`.
- **Rendering Sequence**: The component should:
  - Automatically add `uniqueId`, `level`, and `parentId` if they are not present in the tree data objects.

# Memory Map Scope

## Overall Scope

Here's an expanded version of the "Overall Scope" section with additional details:

- **Rendering Tree Data**: The component should accurately render hierarchical tree data from a provided array and configuration settings.
  - **Data Structure**: The array should consist of objects with fields like `name`, `children`, and optionally `uniqueId`, `level`, and `parentId`.
  - **Hierarchy Representation**: Ensure the component correctly represents the hierarchical relationships among nodes based on the indentation or structure of the data.
  
- **Configuration Handling**: The component should support various configuration settings to control its appearance and behavior, including but not limited to:
  - **Styling**: Allow customization of node and edge styles, such as colors, fonts, and shapes.
  - **Visibility Control**: Provide options to show or hide specific levels or nodes, including toggling visibility for metadata or additional fields.
  - **Expand/Collapse Functionality**: Support interactive features for expanding or collapsing nodes to navigate through the tree structure.

- **Dynamic Updates**: Ensure that the component can handle dynamic changes to the configuration settings, such as:
  - **Responsive Design**: Adjust layout and styling in response to different screen sizes or user interactions.
  - **Real-Time Data Updates**: Reflect changes in the tree data or configuration in real-time without requiring a full page reload.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage:
  - **Invalid Data**: Detect and report issues with malformed or incomplete tree data.
  - **Configuration Errors**: Handle invalid or unsupported configuration settings gracefully.

- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize rendering and interactions to handle large datasets efficiently, including:
  - **Lazy Loading**: Support lazy loading of nodes to improve performance with large trees.
  - **Virtualization**: Use virtualization techniques to render only the visible portion of the tree at any time.

- **Accessibility**: Ensure the component meets accessibility standards to provide a usable experience for all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.

- **Documentation and Testing**: Provide comprehensive documentation and test coverage to ensure the component's functionality and ease of use:
  - **Documentation**: Include usage examples, configuration options, and API references.
  - **Testing**: Implement unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to validate the component's behavior and performance.



## V1 Scope
- **MemoryMapV1**: The initial version should render tree data for a given array.
- **Default Configuration**: If no specific configurations are provided, the following defaults should be applied:
  ```javascript
  const defaultStyles = {
      levelItemStyle: {
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "space-between",
          gap: "5px",
      },
      nodeChildrenItemStyle: {
          marginBottom: "50px",
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "space-between",
      },
      nodeItemStyle: {
          padding: "10px",
          border: "1px solid red",
          fontSize: "10px",
      },
      configurationAndMetadataItemStyle: {
          padding: "10px",
          border: "10px solid green",
          fontSize: "10px",
          flex: "1",
      },
  };


  // Initial shared data
  const initialSharedData = {
      showMetaData: false,
      showAllChildren: false,
      styles: defaultStyles,
  };
  ```
- **Dynamic Re-rendering**: The component should update and re-render based on changes to the configuration object.
  - Expected updates include:
    - **Show/Hide All Children**: Toggle visibility of all children based on changes to `sharedData.showAllChildren`.
    - **Show/Hide MetaData**: Toggle visibility of metadata at all levels and nodes based on `sharedData.showMetaData`.
    - **Dynamic Styling**: Update the color of arrows or other style elements based on fields introduced in `sharedData`.

## Additional Features
- **Interactive Configuration**: Implement interactive features to allow users to modify configurations dynamically and see immediate updates in the tree data rendering.
- **Customization**: Allow for custom styling and metadata display based on user preferences or additional data fields.
