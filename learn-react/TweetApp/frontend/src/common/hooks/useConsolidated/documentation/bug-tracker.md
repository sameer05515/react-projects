### Bug Tracker for `.releases/v400.jsx`

#### 1. **Bug:** Execution Continues After Validator Exception  
   - **Status:** `Closed`  
   - **Description:** Even if the validator function throws an exception, the promise begins executing in the background.  
   - **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Validation for the `apiRequest` argument was being performed *before* executing the `validatorFn`.  
   - **Resolution:** The validation order was updated to ensure `validatorFn` is executed and validated properly before proceeding.

---

#### 2. **Bug:** Non-Promise Execution Issue  
   - **Status:** `On-Hold`  
   - **Description:** When a non-Promise function is passed in the `apiRequest` argument, the `executeApiRequest` function returns an error response. However, the function still executes in the background.  
   - **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** JavaScript/TypeScript lacks a built-in way to check the return type of a function (e.g., `Promise`) without executing it.  
   - **Workaround:** Developers are advised to:  
     1. **Verify Input:** Ensure that the `apiRequest` argument is a valid Promise-returning function before passing it to `executeApiRequest`.  
     2. **Exercise Caution:** Use `executeApiRequest` responsibly to avoid inconsistencies caused by passing non-Promise functions.

#### 3. **Bug:** Fix Infinite API Requests in Router Pages Due to Unoptimized useEffect Dependencies
   - **Status:** `Closed`
   - **Description:**  In the router pages where the `executeApiRequest` function was used inside a `useEffect` hook, it was causing **infinite requests to the server**.
   - **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The `executeApiRequest` function was not wrapped in `useCallback`. Without `useCallback`, the function's reference changes on every render, causing `useEffect` to re-trigger due to dependency array mismatches.
   - **Resolution:** Wrap `executeApiRequest` in `useCallback` to memoize its reference and avoid unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops.
   - **Details:** Please find detailed explaination [**here**](./issue-3-resolution.md)
