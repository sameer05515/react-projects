## Issue # 3: Fix Infinite API Requests in Router Pages Due to Unoptimized useEffect Dependencies
### Explanation of the Issue and Resolution

#### Problem Statement

In the router pages where the `executeApiRequest` function was used inside a `useEffect` hook, it was causing **infinite requests to the server**. The root cause was that `executeApiRequest` was **not optimized with `useCallback`**, which resulted in the function being recreated on every render.

#### Why Infinite Requests Occurred

1. **`useEffect` Dependency Array**:
   - When `executeApiRequest` is passed as a dependency in the `useEffect` hook, the dependency array checks whether the reference of the function has changed between renders.
   - Without `useCallback`, `executeApiRequest` is recreated on every render, as JavaScript treats functions as reference types, and each new function is a new reference.

2. **Re-Execution of `useEffect`**:
   - Since `executeApiRequest` was recreated on every render, `useEffect` detected a change in its dependencies and re-ran the effect, which triggered a new server request, leading to an infinite loop.

#### Solution: Optimize `executeApiRequest` with `useCallback`

By wrapping `executeApiRequest` in `useCallback`, you ensure that its reference remains stable between renders **unless its dependencies change**. This prevents the `useEffect` hook from detecting it as a "new" function, thereby stopping the infinite loop of requests.

### Issue: Infinite Requests to Server

#### Problem
In some router pages, the `executeApiRequest` function was being used inside a `useEffect` hook to trigger API calls. However, this caused an **infinite number of requests** to the server because `executeApiRequest` was being recreated on every render.

#### Root Cause
The `executeApiRequest` function was not wrapped in `useCallback`. Without `useCallback`, the function's reference changes on every render, causing `useEffect` to re-trigger due to dependency array mismatches.

#### Example of Problematic Code
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  executeApiRequest();
}, [executeApiRequest]); // executeApiRequest is recreated on every render
```

#### Resolution
Wrap `executeApiRequest` in `useCallback` to memoize its reference and avoid unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops.

#### Fixed Code Example
```javascript
const executeApiRequest = useCallback(() => {
  // Logic for executing API requests
}, [dependency1, dependency2]); // Include necessary dependencies only

useEffect(() => {
  executeApiRequest();
}, [executeApiRequest]); // Now executeApiRequest reference is stable
```

#### Key Notes
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as dependencies in `useEffect`.
- Ensure dependencies for `useCallback` are correctly specified to avoid stale values or incorrect behavior.
- Verify the stability of all dependencies in `useEffect` to prevent unintended effects.

#### Outcome
After applying `useCallback`, the infinite request issue was resolved, and the server received only the intended number of API calls.

### Takeaways

1. **Stability of Dependencies**:
   - Always ensure that dependencies in hooks like `useEffect` are stable and predictable.
   - Use `useCallback` for functions and `useMemo` for derived values when they are dependencies.

2. **Testing for Infinite Loops**:
   - During testing, monitor network requests in your browser's developer tools to detect unexpected infinite loops.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Use `useCallback` judiciously as it adds a slight overhead. Use it only when the function is passed as a prop or used in a dependency array.

By optimizing your code with `useCallback`, you ensure a stable and efficient implementation, avoiding unnecessary bugs like infinite requests.
