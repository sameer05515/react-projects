Welcome to the project, where our focus is to:
  - Explore and master key terminologies related to Next.js, TypeScript, and React.js.
  - Develop various modules that bring these concepts to life through real-world examples.

Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
  - In this project, we follow the principles of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to manage and track incremental improvements across different components and modules.
  
What is Semantic Versioning (SemVer)?
  - Semantic Versioning is a widely-adopted versioning scheme, helping us communicate the impact of each update clearly. The three parts of a version number, like 1.0.5, represent:
    - **Major version**: The first number (1 in 1.0.5) reflects major changes that could introduce breaking changes.
    - **Minor version**: The second number (0 in 1.0.5) signifies new features or enhancements that are backward-compatible.
    - **Patch version**: The third number (5 in 1.0.5) is for small fixes or minor updates that maintain full compatibility.

By adhering to SemVer, we ensure structured progress and clear communication about each update.
