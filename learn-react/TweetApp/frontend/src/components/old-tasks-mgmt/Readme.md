# About This Module
- This module is currently **`abandoned`** or **`not in use`**.  
- The backend for this module is located in `<GIT-REPO>\react-projects\learn-react\tasks-mgmt\TasksRest`.  
- Within the `<GIT-REPO>\react-projects\learn-react\tasks-mgmt` directory, there are two additional projects:  
  1. A **React frontend project**.  
  2. A **Java backend project**.  
    - These projects can be repurposed for meaningful functionality, depending on future requirements.  

# Why Hasn't This Module Been Deleted?
- Although this module is no longer actively used, it has several components and patterns that can be leveraged to improve other modules:
  - **Reducer Approach for Page Modes**:  
    - This module employs a reducer to manage and switch between various `PageMode`s.  
    - Lessons from this approach can help optimize existing modules like `Topics`, `Tasks`, `Tags`, and others by reducing the number of routes currently in use.  
    - To achieve this, we may need to incorporate advanced React concepts such as `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and router query parameters.  
    - A detailed plan can be formulated after the completion of current high-priority tasks.  
  - **Use of Bootstrap Components**:  
    - This module makes extensive use of `Bootstrap` components, which can be studied to reduce the size of individual source code files for components.  
  - **Use of `@mui/material` Components**
    - This module also makes extensive use of `@mui/material` components, which can be studied to reduce the size of individual source code files for components. 

- Additionally, this module serves as a **`testing ground`** for developing and experimenting with **new functionalities** that are yet to be implemented.  

# Current Status and Plans
## 29-Dec-2024
- Began **refactoring components** to establish a more intuitive and maintainable **component hierarchy structure**.  
- No functionality-related changes will be made during this phase of refactoring.  
  - In the future, I aim to repurpose this module into either a **`to-do management`** or **`worklog management`** module, with significant improvements to the codebase.
