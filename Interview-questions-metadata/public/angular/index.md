## Definition
### From wikipedia
> Angular is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework run on Node.js. It is led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

### From Internet
> Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner. 

### From ChatGPT
> Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google and provides a robust set of tools and features to help developers build and maintain complex web applications.

Here are some key aspects of Angular:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Angular applications are built using components, which are the fundamental building blocks of the user interface. Each component encapsulates its own structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (TypeScript).

2. **Two-Way Data Binding**:
   - Angular supports two-way data binding, which means that any changes in the user interface are immediately reflected in the underlying data model and vice versa. This makes it easier to manage and synchronize the state of the application.

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Angular has a built-in dependency injection framework that allows developers to define and inject dependencies in a flexible and modular way. This makes it easier to manage services and other resources across the application.

4. **Directives and Pipes**:
   - Directives are special markers in the DOM that extend HTML's capabilities by adding custom behavior to elements and attributes. Pipes allow developers to transform and format data in the template.

5. **Routing**:
   - Angular's router enables developers to define navigation paths and manage different views within a single-page application. This allows for creating complex navigation structures with nested routes and lazy loading of modules.

6. **Forms and Validation**:
   - Angular provides powerful tools for building and managing forms, including template-driven and reactive forms. It also includes built-in validation mechanisms and supports custom validators.

7. **Observables and RxJS**:
   - Angular leverages RxJS, a library for reactive programming using observables. This helps manage asynchronous data streams and events in a more predictable and composable way.

8. **Angular CLI**:
   - The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that helps developers scaffold, build, test, and deploy Angular applications. It streamlines the development workflow and ensures best practices are followed.

9. **Modularity**:
   - Angular applications are structured into modules, which are containers for related components, directives, pipes, and services. This modularity promotes code organization and reuse.

10. **Performance and Scalability**:
    - Angular includes features like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and tree shaking to optimize the performance and reduce the size of the application. It is designed to handle large and complex applications efficiently.

Overall, Angular provides a comprehensive and opinionated framework for building modern web applications, making it a popular choice among developers for developing dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
