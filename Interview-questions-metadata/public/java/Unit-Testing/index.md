# is spring boot has some testing library?

Yes, Spring Boot does indeed provide support for testing through its testing library. The primary testing framework used in conjunction with Spring Boot is JUnit, which allows developers to write and execute unit tests for their Spring Boot applications. Additionally, Spring Boot provides integration testing support through the Spring Test framework, which allows for testing of Spring components within the application context.

So while Spring Boot itself doesn't have its own separate testing library, it leverages existing testing frameworks like JUnit and Spring Test to facilitate testing of Spring Boot applications.
