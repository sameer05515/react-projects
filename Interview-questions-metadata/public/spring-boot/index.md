# What are commonly used annotations in spring boot

In Spring Boot, annotations play a crucial role in configuring and customizing various aspects of the application. Here are some commonly used annotations in Spring Boot:

1. **@SpringBootApplication**: This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines the functionality of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.

2. **@RestController**: This annotation is used to define a class as a RESTful controller, which automatically handles HTTP requests and generates appropriate responses.

3. **@RequestMapping**: This annotation is used to map HTTP requests to specific handler methods in a controller class. It allows you to specify the URL path and the HTTP method for handling the request.

4. **@Autowired**: This annotation is used to inject dependencies into a class. It enables automatic dependency injection, reducing the need for manual wiring.

5. **@Service**: This annotation is used to mark a class as a service component. It is typically used in the service layer to encapsulate business logic.

6. **@Repository**: This annotation is used to mark a class as a repository component. It is used in the persistence layer to interact with the database or other data sources.

7. **@Component**: This annotation is a generic annotation used to mark a class as a Spring component. It is used when no more specific stereotype annotations (like @Service or @Repository) apply.

8. **@Configuration**: This annotation is used to indicate that a class provides bean configurations. It is often used in conjunction with `@Bean` to define beans explicitly.

9. **@Value**: This annotation is used to inject values from properties files or environment variables into fields, constructor arguments, or method parameters.

10. **@EnableScheduling**: This annotation is used to enable scheduling support in a Spring Boot application. It allows you to schedule tasks using cron expressions or fixed delays.

These are just a few examples of commonly used annotations in Spring Boot. Spring Boot provides a wide range of annotations that simplify the configuration and development of Spring applications, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications.


# What are commonly used commands in spring boot

In Spring Boot, there are several commonly used commands and tools that help with building, testing, and running Spring Boot applications. Here are some of them:

1. **mvn spring-boot:run**: This Maven command is used to run a Spring Boot application. It automatically compiles the code, resolves dependencies, and starts the embedded server.

2. **./gradlew bootRun**: If you're using Gradle, this command is used to run a Spring Boot application. It builds and runs the application using the Gradle wrapper.

3. **mvn clean install**: This command builds the Spring Boot application and packages it into an executable JAR or WAR file. The resulting artifact can be deployed to a server or run independently.

4. **java -jar**: You can run a packaged Spring Boot application using the `java -jar` command followed by the path to the JAR file.

   Example: `java -jar myapp.jar`

5. **mvn test**: This command runs all the unit tests in the Spring Boot application using Maven. It executes the test cases defined in the project.

6. **./gradlew test**: If you're using Gradle, this command runs the unit tests in the Spring Boot application using the Gradle wrapper.

7. **spring-boot-starter**: This is a common dependency used in Spring Boot applications. It provides a set of pre-configured libraries and configurations for various features, such as web applications, data access, security, and more.

8. **spring-boot-cli**: The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool that allows you to quickly create, develop, and test Spring Boot applications. It provides a convenient way to run Groovy scripts as Spring Boot applications.

9. **spring-boot:run**: This is a Maven plugin that allows you to run Spring Boot applications directly from the command line using Maven.

10. **spring-boot actuator**: The Spring Boot Actuator provides endpoints and metrics to monitor and manage a Spring Boot application. It exposes various management and monitoring endpoints for health checks, metrics, logging, etc.

These are some commonly used commands and tools in Spring Boot. They help in building, testing, and running Spring Boot applications, making it easier to develop robust and production-ready applications.



# Please write commonly used annotations for Spring boot 

Certainly! Here are some commonly used annotations in Spring Boot along with their purposes:

1. **@SpringBootApplication:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines three other annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It tells Spring Boot to start auto-configuring the application based on its classpath and enables component scanning to find Spring components.

2. **@Controller:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is used to mark a class as a controller in Spring MVC. Controllers handle HTTP requests and typically return a response to the client. They are responsible for processing user input, invoking the appropriate business logic, and returning a view or JSON response.

3. **@RestController:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller` that is used to create RESTful web services in Spring MVC. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, indicating that methods in the class return data rather than views. Responses are automatically serialized to JSON or XML, making it easy to build REST APIs.

4. **@Service:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is used to mark a class as a service component in Spring. Service classes contain business logic and are typically used to encapsulate application functionality. They are responsible for processing data, performing operations, and coordinating interactions between different components.

5. **@Repository:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is used to mark a class as a data access component in Spring. Repository classes are used to interact with a database or other data sources. They encapsulate database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, and often use Spring Data's repository support for common CRUD operations.

6. **@Component:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is a generic stereotype annotation used to mark a class as a Spring component. It indicates that the class is a Spring-managed component and should be automatically detected and registered by the Spring container during component scanning. It is commonly used for classes that don't fit into more specific stereotypes like `@Controller`, `@Service`, or `@Repository`.

7. **@Autowired:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is used to inject dependencies into Spring beans. It enables automatic dependency injection by Spring's dependency injection container. When applied to a field, constructor, or setter method, Spring will automatically resolve and inject the appropriate dependency at runtime.

8. **@RequestMapping:**
   - Purpose: This annotation is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods in Spring MVC controllers. It specifies the URL pattern or patterns that a controller method should respond to, as well as the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that it should handle. It can be applied at the class level or method level to define request mappings.

These are some of the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot applications, covering various aspects such as controller handling, service components, data access, and dependency injection.

Of course! Here are a few more commonly used annotations in Spring Boot:

9. **@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping:**
   - **Purpose:** These annotations are shortcuts for `@RequestMapping` with specific HTTP methods. They are used to define handler methods in Spring MVC controllers for handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, respectively. They provide a more concise and expressive way to define request mappings for specific HTTP methods.

10. **@PathVariable:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to extract values from the URI path of a request. It binds the value of a URI template variable to a method parameter in a Spring MVC controller. It is commonly used to capture dynamic parts of the URL path, such as IDs or names, and pass them to controller methods for processing.

11. **@RequestParam:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to extract query parameters from the URL of a request. It binds the value of a request parameter to a method parameter in a Spring MVC controller. It is commonly used to retrieve data submitted through HTML forms or as query parameters in RESTful APIs.

12. **@RequestBody:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to bind the body of an HTTP request to a method parameter in a Spring MVC controller. It is commonly used to deserialize JSON or XML request bodies into Java objects when processing POST or PUT requests in RESTful APIs.

13. **@ResponseBody:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to indicate that the return value of a method should be serialized and sent as the response body of an HTTP request. It is commonly used in conjunction with `@RestController` to return data from controller methods as JSON or XML responses in RESTful APIs.

14. **@Valid:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to enable bean validation on method parameters or return values in Spring MVC controllers. It triggers validation of annotated objects using the configured validation constraints, such as annotations from the javax.validation package like @NotNull, @Size, etc.

15. **@Transactional:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to mark a method or class as transactional in Spring applications. It enables declarative transaction management, ensuring that annotated methods are executed within a transactional context. It is commonly used to define transactional boundaries around service methods that interact with databases or other transactional resources.

16. **@Configuration:**
    - **Purpose:** This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a configuration class in Spring. Configuration classes typically contain bean definitions, component scans, and other configuration settings for the Spring application context. It is commonly used in conjunction with `@Bean` to define beans explicitly in Java-based configuration.

These annotations provide additional functionality and flexibility in Spring Boot applications, allowing developers to handle various aspects of request handling, data binding, validation, transaction management, and configuration.
