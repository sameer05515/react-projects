/**
 * ## CustomBackdropV3 Component Documentation
 *
 * ### Overview:
 * `CustomBackdropV3` is an advanced iteration of the `CustomBackdrop` component, currently in the testing phase.
 * This version serves as a development and enhancement playground for addressing issues and incorporating
 * improvements identified in the previous production version, [`v2.jsx`](./v2.jsx).
 *
 * ### Purpose:
 * - To refine and enhance the existing functionality of `CustomBackdropV2`.
 * - To serve as a testing ground for experimenting with creative solutions,
 *   especially around new features and design ideas.
 * - To ensure a well-rounded, thoroughly tested, and business-approved component for future production use.
 *
 * ### Key Changes from `CustomBackdropV2`:
 * 1. **Fallback Logic for Auto-Closing Removed:**
 *    - The fallback auto-closing logic has been deliberately excluded from this version.
 *    - This gives developers the flexibility to explore innovative and creative
 *      solutions for auto-closing behavior or related functionalities.
 * 2. **Focus on Creativity:**
 *    - Developers are encouraged to think outside the box while implementing and testing enhancements.
 *    - This version prioritizes functional and design flexibility during its testing and grooming phase.
 * 3. **Business Approval Pipeline:**
 *    - Once the functionality and design are finalized and approved by stakeholders,
 *      this component will undergo optimization for production readiness.
 *
 * ### Developer Guidelines:
 * - **Testing and Feedback:**
 *   - Developers should rigorously test all new additions and modifications to ensure they align
 *     with the desired functionality and do not introduce regressions.
 *   - Provide constructive feedback or suggestions for improvement to foster collaboration.
 * - **Creativity with Responsibility:**
 *   - While creativity is encouraged, all implementations must adhere to best practices
 *     in React development, such as proper state management, performance optimization,
 *     and adherence to accessibility standards.
 * - **Versioning and Documentation:**
 *   - Maintain clear versioning to track the evolution of the component.
 *   - Document all changes thoroughly, including the rationale behind design or
 *     functional decisions.
 *
 * ### Next Steps:
 * - Once testing is complete, and feedback is incorporated, `CustomBackdropV3` will be
 *   optimized and finalized for production deployment.
 * - Ensure proper handoff and communication with the QA and business teams for final approval.
 *
 * ### Note to Developers:
 * This phase is critical for laying the foundation for the next stable production version.
 * Your contributions and insights are vital in making `CustomBackdropV3` a robust,
 * scalable, and user-friendly component.
