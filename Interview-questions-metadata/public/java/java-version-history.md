6. **Java 6 (JDK 1.6 - December 2006):**
   - **Scripting Support (JSR 223):** Added support for scripting languages through the Java Scripting API (javax.script package), allowing Java applications to execute scripts written in languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.
   - **Compiler API (JSR 199):** Introduced the Compiler API for programmatic access to the Java compiler, enabling tools and frameworks to compile Java source code at runtime.

7. **Java 7 (JDK 1.7 - July 2011):**
   - **Project Coin:** Introduced small language enhancements as part of Project Coin, including the diamond operator (`<>`), try-with-resources statement, strings in switch statements, and improved exception handling.
   - **Fork/Join Framework:** Introduced the Fork/Join Framework for parallelizing computations and processing large data sets in a multi-core environment.
   - **NIO.2 (JSR 203):** Enhanced the New I/O (NIO) package with the java.nio.file package for improved support for file system operations, file attributes, and asynchronous I/O.

These are some of the major Java versions from 1 to 7, along with notable enhancements introduced in each version. Each version brought significant improvements and new features to the Java platform, contributing to its evolution as a versatile and widely-used programming language.

Here are some of the major Java versions along with notable enhancements introduced in each version:

1. **Java 8 (March 2014):**
   - **Lambda Expressions:** Introduced functional programming capabilities with lambda expressions, enabling a more concise syntax for writing code.
   - **Streams API:** Introduced the Streams API for processing collections of data in a declarative and parallelizable manner.
   - **Date and Time API:** Introduced the `java.time` package for improved date and time handling, addressing the limitations of the legacy `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.

2. **Java 9 (September 2017):**
   - **Module System (Project Jigsaw):** Introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) to modularize the JDK and applications, enabling better encapsulation and scalability.
   - **JShell (REPL):** Introduced JShell, a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool for experimenting with Java code interactively.
   - **Process API Updates:** Enhanced the `java.lang.Process` API with new methods for controlling and managing operating system processes.

3. **Java 10 (March 2018):**
   - **Local-Variable Type Inference (var):** Introduced the `var` keyword for type inference, allowing developers to declare local variables without explicitly specifying their types.
   - **Consolidated Garbage Collection (G1):** Improved the performance and scalability of the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector.
   - **Application Class-Data Sharing (CDS):** Introduced Application Class-Data Sharing to improve startup time and reduce memory footprint by sharing common class metadata among JVM instances.

4. **Java 11 (September 2018):**
   - **HTTP Client API:** Introduced a new HTTP client API (`java.net.http`) for making HTTP requests and handling responses in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner.
   - **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters:** Extended type inference to lambda parameters, allowing the use of `var` in lambda expressions.
   - **Flight Recorder (JFR):** Open-sourced Java Flight Recorder, a low-overhead profiling tool for monitoring and diagnosing JVM and application performance.

5. **Java 12 (March 2019):**
   - **Switch Expressions (Preview):** Introduced a new syntax for switch statements with enhanced expressiveness, allowing switch expressions to be used as both statements and expressions.
   - **JVM Constants API:** Introduced the `java.lang.constant` package for representing nominal descriptors of class-file and run-time artifacts, providing a standardized way to access constants in a type-safe manner.

6. **Java 13 (September 2019):**
   - **Text Blocks (Preview):** Introduced text blocks, a multi-line string literal feature for writing more readable and maintainable string literals in Java code.
   - **Switch Expressions (Final Release):** Made switch expressions a standard feature of the Java language, removing the preview status introduced in Java 12.
   - **Dynamic CDS Archives:** Enhanced Class-Data Sharing (CDS) with support for dynamic archiving, allowing classes to be loaded dynamically and included in shared archives.

7. **Java 14 (March 2020):**
   - **Pattern Matching (Preview):** Introduced pattern matching for `instanceof` expressions, enabling more concise and expressive code for type checks and type casts.
   - **Records (Preview):** Introduced records, a new type of class with a concise syntax for modeling immutable data aggregates.
   - **Switch Expressions (Enhancements):** Enhanced switch expressions with additional features such as `yield` and `yield ->` for more flexibility.

8. **Java 15 (September 2020):**
   - **Sealed Classes (Preview):** Introduced sealed classes and interfaces, allowing developers to restrict the set of subclasses that can extend or implement them.
   - **Text Blocks (Final Release):** Made text blocks a standard feature of the Java language, removing the preview status introduced in Java 13.
   - **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector):** Made the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) generally available on macOS and Windows platforms, providing improved scalability and low-latency performance for large heaps.

These are some of the major Java versions along with notable enhancements introduced in each version. Java continues to evolve with new features and improvements in subsequent releases.
