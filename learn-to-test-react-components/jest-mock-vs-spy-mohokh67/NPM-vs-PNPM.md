# what is difference between npm and pnpm?

Both **npm** (Node Package Manager) and **pnpm** (Performant npm) are package managers for JavaScript projects. They manage dependencies and provide tools for installing, updating, and managing packages. However, they differ in how they manage dependencies, their performance, and additional features. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Installation of Dependencies**
- **npm**:
  - Installs all dependencies in a **flat structure** in the `node_modules` folder.
  - This can lead to duplicate package installations because different packages might install the same dependency at different versions.

- **pnpm**:
  - Uses a **symlinked structure**.
  - Keeps only one copy of each package version in a central store on your machine (`~/.pnpm-store`).
  - Creates symlinks in the `node_modules` folder pointing to the central store.
  - This approach avoids duplication and saves disk space.

---

### **2. Performance**
- **npm**:
  - Slower compared to pnpm when installing large dependency trees, as it installs everything directly into the project folder.

- **pnpm**:
  - Much faster because it reuses already-downloaded packages from the global store.
  - Optimized for speed and disk efficiency, especially in monorepo setups.

---

### **3. Handling Disk Space**
- **npm**:
  - Consumes more disk space due to duplication of dependencies across different projects.

- **pnpm**:
  - Saves disk space by using a shared, global store for dependencies.

---

### **4. Dependency Resolution**
- **npm**:
  - Resolves dependencies using a flat `node_modules` structure, which can lead to dependency conflicts if package versions overlap.

- **pnpm**:
  - Enforces strict dependency resolution.
  - Ensures that each dependency has its own `node_modules` folder, maintaining isolation and avoiding unexpected dependency issues.

---

### **5. Monorepo Support**
- **npm**:
  - Limited support for monorepos without additional tools like `lerna`.

- **pnpm**:
  - Built-in support for **monorepos**.
  - Provides the `pnpm workspaces` feature, allowing efficient sharing of dependencies across multiple packages in a monorepo.

---

### **6. Lockfile**
- **npm**:
  - Uses a `package-lock.json` file to lock dependencies.

- **pnpm**:
  - Uses a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, which is more compact and optimized for performance.

---

### **7. Command Compatibility**
- **npm**:
  - Well-established, default package manager for Node.js projects.

- **pnpm**:
  - Commands are similar to npm (e.g., `pnpm install`, `pnpm run`), making it easy for developers to switch.

---

### **8. Additional Features**
- **npm**:
  - Focuses on simplicity and wide compatibility.

- **pnpm**:
  - Features like `pnpm fetch` (pre-fetch dependencies) and improved CI performance.
  - Protects against accidental modification of `node_modules` by locking down permissions.

---

### **Which One to Use?**
- **Choose npm** if:
  - You need simplicity and are working on small projects or single-repo setups.
  - You rely on the default Node.js tools without requiring additional configuration.

- **Choose pnpm** if:
  - You want faster installs and reduced disk usage.
  - You're working on large projects or monorepos where dependency management efficiency is critical.
  - You want stricter dependency isolation to avoid unexpected conflicts.

Both tools are excellent, and the choice depends on the scale of your project and your specific needs.


# as i have not used pnpm yet, hence most of my node projects uses npm approach. can i use pnpm for my newer projects, while leaving the existing one on npm untill i test them and gradually paln to move to newer approach accordingly??

Yes, you can absolutely use **pnpm** for your newer projects while leaving your existing projects on **npm**. Both package managers can coexist on the same system without any conflicts. Here's how you can approach this:

---

### **How to Use pnpm for New Projects:**

1. **Install pnpm Globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. **Initialize a New Project with pnpm:**
   - When starting a new project, use pnpm for dependency management.
     ```bash
     pnpm init
     pnpm install <package-name>
     ```

3. **Use `.npmrc` to Set pnpm for the New Project:**
   - Add a `.npmrc` file to your new project with the following line:
     ```
     package-manager=pnpm
     ```
   - This ensures that the project is explicitly tied to pnpm and avoids accidental usage of npm.

---

### **Leaving Existing Projects on npm:**

1. **Continue Using npm for Existing Projects:**
   - For older projects, continue using npm commands like:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run <script>
     ```

2. **No Conflict Between npm and pnpm:**
   - Each project will respect the package manager it was set up with. Since pnpm creates a unique `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and uses a different dependency structure, it won’t interfere with npm's `package-lock.json` or `node_modules`.

---

### **Gradually Migrating to pnpm:**

If you want to migrate older projects to **pnpm** gradually, you can do the following:

1. **Test Migration Locally:**
   - In an existing npm project, try switching to pnpm temporarily:
     ```bash
     pnpm import
     ```
   - This will convert your `package-lock.json` to a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.

2. **Install Dependencies with pnpm:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   - Verify that everything works as expected.

3. **Revert Back if Needed:**
   - If there are issues, you can revert to npm by deleting `pnpm-lock.yaml` and using `npm install`.

4. **Update Scripts and CI Configurations Gradually:**
   - If you decide to stick with pnpm for a project, update your build and deployment pipelines to use pnpm commands instead of npm.

---

### **Advantages of Using Both npm and pnpm:**

- **Isolated Workflow:** Your existing npm-based projects will continue to work without any changes.
- **Test and Compare:** You can experiment with pnpm's features and performance on new projects without risking compatibility issues with older projects.
- **Gradual Adoption:** Gives you time to learn pnpm’s ecosystem and decide if it fits your workflow before committing to a full transition.

This approach ensures a smooth transition and minimizes the risk of disruption to your ongoing projects.
