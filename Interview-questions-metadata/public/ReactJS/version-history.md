## Please write evolution of reactjs

Sure, here's a brief overview of the evolution of ReactJS:

1. **Original Release (2013)**: ReactJS was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and was open-sourced in 2013. React introduced the concept of a Virtual DOM, which allowed for efficient updates to the UI.

2. **Introduction of JSX (2013)**: React introduced JSX, a syntax extension that allowed developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to write and understand React components.

3. **React Native (2015)**: React Native was released, enabling developers to build mobile applications using React. It allowed for the development of cross-platform mobile apps with native-like performance.

4. **Introduction of Hooks (2018)**: React introduced Hooks, which are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. This made it easier to reuse stateful logic between components and write cleaner functional components.

5. **Concurrent Mode and Suspense (2020)**: React introduced Concurrent Mode and Suspense, which are features aimed at improving the user experience by enabling smoother interactions and better handling of asynchronous operations.

6. **React 18 and Beyond**: While I can't predict the future, it's likely that React will continue to evolve with improvements in performance, developer experience, and new features to keep up with the changing landscape of web development.
