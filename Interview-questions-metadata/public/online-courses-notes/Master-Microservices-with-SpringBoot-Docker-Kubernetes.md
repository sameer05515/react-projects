## Acceptance criteria and Expectations from this course
- I should become familiar with the concepts.
- I should also be able to implement the concepts and build a sample microservice.

And here are a few more points to be added in the list:

- I expect to gain practical experience in deploying microservices using Docker and Kubernetes.
- I aim to understand best practices for designing scalable and resilient microservice architectures.
- I hope to learn about service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance mechanisms in microservices.
- I look forward to exploring tools and frameworks commonly used in microservices development, such as Spring Boot, Eureka, Ribbon, and Hystrix.
- I anticipate gaining insights into monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting microservices in a distributed environment.
- I aspire to grasp the principles of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for microservices applications.
- I would like to understand how microservices architecture aligns with modern software development methodologies like Agile and DevOps.
- I aim to learn about security considerations and strategies for securing microservices and their communication channels.
- I hope to gain insights into microservices testing strategies, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
- I expect to understand the principles of container orchestration and how Kubernetes enables efficient management of containerized applications.
- I look forward to exploring patterns for inter-service communication, such as RESTful APIs, messaging queues, and event-driven architectures.
- I aim to learn about strategies for data management and persistence in microservices, including database per service and event sourcing.
- I anticipate gaining knowledge about scaling strategies for microservices applications, including horizontal and vertical scaling approaches.
- I hope to understand the trade-offs involved in microservices architecture, such as increased complexity, distributed data management, and operational overhead.
- I look forward to gaining practical experience in deploying microservices in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
- I aim to explore advanced topics such as service mesh architectures, circuit breakers, and API gateways in the context of microservices.
- I expect to learn about strategies for versioning and backward compatibility in microservices to facilitate seamless updates and deployments.
- I hope to gain insights into the cultural and organizational changes required to adopt a microservices architecture successfully.

These additional points cover a wide range of topics related to microservices development, deployment, testing, and maintenance, providing a comprehensive set of expectations for the course.
