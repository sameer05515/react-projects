# Microservice design patterns

## Name some Microservice design patterns

Microservice architecture relies on various design patterns to address challenges like scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability. Some common microservice design patterns include:

1. **Service Registry:**
   - **Description:** Maintain a central registry where microservices can register their location and discover other services.
   - **Benefits:** Dynamic service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

2. **API Gateway:**
   - **Description:** A single entry point that manages requests, handles composition of microservices, and provides additional functionalities like authentication and caching.
   - **Benefits:** Simplifies client-side experience, centralizes management, and enhances security.

3. **Circuit Breaker:**
   - **Description:** Prevents cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to a failing service, allowing it to recover.
   - **Benefits:** Improves system resilience by avoiding prolonged failures.

4. **Bulkhead:**
   - **Description:** Isolates components of a system to prevent the failure of one from affecting others.
   - **Benefits:** Limits the impact of failures, improves overall system stability.

5. **Saga Pattern:**
   - **Description:** Manages distributed transactions across multiple microservices by using a sequence of local transactions.
   - **Benefits:** Ensures consistency in a distributed system.

6. **Event Sourcing:**
   - **Description:** Instead of storing the current state of an entity, maintain a sequence of events that can be used to reconstruct the entity's state.
   - **Benefits:** Provides a historical view, simplifies audit trails, and supports scalability.

7. **Choreography vs. Orchestration:**
   - **Description:** Defines how microservices communicate and coordinate actions. Orchestration is centralized, while choreography relies on decentralized communication.
   - **Benefits:** Flexibility and autonomy in choreography, centralized control in orchestration.

8. **Sidecar Pattern:**
   - **Description:** Attach additional functionalities (sidecar) to the main microservice, like logging, monitoring, or security features.
   - **Benefits:** Modularity, easier maintenance, and uniform application of cross-cutting concerns.

9. **Dependency Injection:**
   - **Description:** Inject dependencies into microservices, allowing better testability and flexibility.
   - **Benefits:** Decouples components, simplifies testing, and promotes modular design.

10. **Health Check:**
   - **Description:** Regularly check the health of microservices to identify and handle potential issues proactively.
   - **Benefits:** Improves reliability and facilitates automatic scaling.

These patterns help address various concerns in microservices architecture, contributing to a more robust and scalable system.
