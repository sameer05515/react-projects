# Recursive React Tree

### Practical Recursion with React Components

This repo exists as a working example of my blog "Practical Recursion with React Components".

Simply install the project and run ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` in the root directory. 

Your app will run on <http://localhost:3000> and render with an expandable tree on the page. The tree is rendered with a recursive rendering pattern, and is a great start to building a recursive component that makes sense!

I hope this helps with your projects!
